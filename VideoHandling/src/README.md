# GUI for Youtube Downloader
A GUI-based wrapper to the excellent yt-dlp utility.

## Motivation

* **As** a viewer of community videos 
* **I want** a download utility [1] 
* With a user interface that allows me to focus on the important points [2]
* And which has sensible defaults for options that I don't need to change [3]
* **So that** I can spend more time downloading and viewing
* And less time fighting with the command line 

###### [1] This is [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme), of course. It is an excellent utility, and in doing...  
###### [2] my sad little GUI, I am taking liberties with the shoulders of giants. Certainly there are other wrappers out there, with better coding than mine, but this gave me a chance to practise a number of languages in a small way that is useful to me. 
###### [3] Really, all I want to change between runs is the video id. OK, there are options for sub-folders to save to, and to save a list of videos (this right now 03.2022 a bit iffy), but if you took those options away, I would still be happy

## Usage
Whilst you will need to do setup before you can use this wrapper, this may seem the wrong sequence. However, I figured that first reading how you use it would help you decide whether it was for you, before moving on to setup.
