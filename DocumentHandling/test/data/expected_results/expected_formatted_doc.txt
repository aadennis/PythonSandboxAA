setting the scene
1. Cows
1.1 the cow in the field
When I got to the other side of the gate, the bull had gone, but some cows were looking scarily protective of their young. I edged along the corner of the sodden field, regretting the loss of a single wellington, both on grounds of comfort and safety.  Injury was very nearly added to insult when the pilot of the autogyro cocked his maxim  as he flew towards me. Happily, the machine gun failed after a single round, and the  tiny helicopter, pilot, gun and all, smashed into a sorry oak. It hadn't previously  been sorry, but now it sure was. The advantage to me was that bull, cows and calves were  thoroughly startled, and galumphed to the next field, leaving me to make a soggy exit  to relative safety as a pedestrian now limping, now stumbling along the A34.
1.2 A trip up the road
I chose Launceston as my destination, trying and mostly failing to keep to a 30cm strip of pavement between an unending series of brick walls, and an unending stream of wing mirrors  on lorries, whistling past my ears at 5 second intervals.
2. Jam today
2.1 mouldy
The arse-end of a number of jars loosely fitting the description of "jam" sat unloved on the communal table of the B&B. Eat? A hint of green at the bottom of at least two of those made the decision for me. 
2.2 Get out
I closed the front door quietly, and headed for The Shops, hopeful that I would find somewhere to eat, which could boast at least 3, ok, 2 hygiene stars.
3. Close encounters
3.1 aliens
I have always felt it unwise to broadcast that we are here. Why would aliens show any less greed for resources protected by feeble competitors then we have, if that is a mark of "intelligence"? And so it proved. With the technology to kill, at will, the bulk of the human population, while preserving more useful resources, no-one escaped. Well, almost no-one. But romantic and ignorant hopes that a computer virus devised by Earth could somehow spike the guns of the invasion? I blame Independence Day. 
3.2 Limited time
So like our own individual lives, which are over before we have had time to properly consider their meaning and value, Humanity will soon be gone, with no legacy worth preserving.
