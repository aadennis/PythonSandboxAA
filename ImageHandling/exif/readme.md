Add subject tags to an image file

Motivation
Neither google nor Onedrive have a simple command line way to add subject exif tags (e.g. #sport, #football, etc) to an image or batch of images. 
This script aims to fill that gap: given a file or a set of files matching some condition, add a subject exif tag to that file(s).
If that file is in say a OneDrive folder, then you can search for all tags with a given name (again, e.g. #sport etc)
