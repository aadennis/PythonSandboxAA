the Wild Rover - The Dubliners

I've [G]been a wild rover for many's the [C]year. I've [G]spent all me [C]money on [D]whiskey and [G]beer
But [G]now I'm returning with gold in great [C]store. And I [G]never will [C]play the wild [D]rover no [G]more
 
And it's [D]no, nay, never. [G]No, nay, never, no [C]more. Will I [G]play the wild [C]rover. No, [D]never, no [G]more

I [G]went into an ale-house I used to fre[C]quent. I [G]told the land[C]lady me [D]money was [G]spent
I [G]asked her for credit, she answered me, [C]"Nay. Such a [G]custom as [C]yours I can [D]have any [G]day"

I [G]took from my pocket ten sovereigns [C]bright. And the [G]landlady's [C]eyes opened [D]wide with de[G]light
She [G]says, "I have whiskeys and wines of the [C]best". And the [G]words that she [C]told me were [D]only in [G]jest

I'll [G]go home to my parents, confess what I've [C]done. And I'll [G]ask them to [C]pardon their [D]prodigal [G]son
And [G]when they've caressed me as oft' times be[C]fore. Then I [G]never will [C]play the wild [D]rover no [G]more
