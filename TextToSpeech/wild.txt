The Manchester Rambler - Ewan MacColl


[C]I've been over Snowdon, I've slept upon Crowdon, I've camped by the Wayne-stones as [G]well
[G]I've sunbathed on Kind. Er, been burned to a cinder, And many more things I can [C] tell
[C]My rucksack has oft been me [G]pillow, The heather has oft been my [C]bed
[C]Sooner than part from the [G] mountains, I think I would rather be [C]dead

[C]I'm a rambler, I'm a rambler from [G]Manchester way. I get all me pleasure the [C]hard moorland way
I may be a wage-slave on [G]Monday, But I am a free man on [C]Sunday
 
The [C]day was just ending and I was descending, Down Grinesbrook just by Upper [G]Tor
[G]When a voice cried "Hey you" in the way keepers do, He'd the worst face that ever I [C]saw
The things that he said were un-[G]pleasant, In the teeth of his fury I [C] said 
[C]Sooner than part from the [G] mountains, I think I would rather be [C]dead

He [C]called me a louse and said "Think of the grouse"
Well I thought, but I still couldn't [G]see
[G]Why all Kinder Scout and the moors roundabout
Couldn't take both the poor grouse and [C]me
He said "All this land is my [G]master's", At that I stood shaking me [C]head
No man has the right to own [G]mountains, Any more than the deep ocean[C] bed


I [C]once loved a maid, a spot welder by trade
She was fair as the Rowan in [G]bloom
[G]And the blue of her eye matched the blue Moreland sky
I wooed her from April to [C]June
On the day that we should have been [G]married, I went for a ramble in-[C]stead
For sooner than part from the [G]mountains, I think I would rather be [C]dead


So I'll [C]walk where I will over mountain and hill, 
and I'll lie where the bracken is [G]deep
[G] I belong to the mountains, the clear running fountains
Where the grey rocks lie ragged and [C]steep
I've seen the white hare in the [G] gullys, And the curlew fly high over-[C]head
And sooner than part from the [G] mountains, I think I would rather be [C] dead
