Whiskey in the Jar - The Dubliners

As [C]I was going over the [Am]far famed Kerry Mountains. I [F]met with Captain Farrell and his [C]money  he was counting 
I [C]first produced my pistol. and I [Am]then produced my rapier. Saying, [F]"Stand and deliver. for you [C]are a bold deceiver" 

Mush-a [G]ring dub-a-doo-dub-a-da. [F]Whack fall the daddy-oh. [F]Whack fall the daddy-oh. There's [C]whiskey [G]in the [C]jar 

I [C]counted out his money. and it [Am]made a pretty penny. I [F]put it in me pocket. and I [C]took it home to Jenny
She [C]sighed and she swore. that she [Am]never would deceive me. But the [F]devil take the woman. for they [C]never can be easy

I [C]went into my chamber, all [Am]for to take a slumber. I [F]dreamt of gold and jewels. and for [C]sure it was no wonder
But [C]Jenny drew me charges. and she [Am]filled them up with water. Then [F]sent for Captain Farrell. to be [C]ready for the slaughter

'Twas [C]early in the morning. just be[Am]fore I rose to travel. Up [F]comes a band of footmen. and [C]likewise Captain Farrell
I [C]first produced me pistol. for she [Am]stole away me rapier. But I [F]couldn't shoot with water. so a [C]prisoner I was taken

If [C]anyone can aid me, 'tis my [Am]brother in the army. If [F]I can find his station. from [C]Cork or in Killarney
And [C]if he'd go with me, we'll go [Am]roving in Kilkenny. And I'm [F]sure he'd treat me better. than me [C]always sporting Jenny 

Mush-a [G]ring dub-a-doo-dub-a-da. [F]Whack fall the daddy-oh. [F]Whack fall the daddy-oh. There's [C]whiskey [G]in the [C]jar
