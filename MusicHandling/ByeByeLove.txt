A             E                 A
There goes my baby with someone new
A              E                A
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
A          D                    E
She was my baby till he stepped in
           E                       A
Goodbye to romance that might have been

                 E                         A
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
                 E                  A
I'm through with counting the stars above
               D                  E
And here's the reason that I'm so free
          E                    A
My lovin' baby is through with me

I think I'm a gonna cry
D       A     D       A             D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
A           E       A               E         A

Bye bye my love, goodbye
