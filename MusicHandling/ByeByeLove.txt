
Capo:
no capo

[Verse 1]
 
D              A7               D
There goes my baby with someone new
                A7              D
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
            G                   A7
She was my baby till he stepped in
           A7                      D
Goodbye to romance that might have been
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G        D    G        D          G      D
Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
              A7    D
I think I'm a gonna cry
G        D    G        D            G      D
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
            A7       D               A7        D  A  D
I feel like I could die, bye bye my love, goodbye
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                 A7                         D
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
                 A7                    D
I'm through with counting the stars above
                 G                 A7
And here's the reason that I'm so free
           A7                  D
My lovin' baby is through with me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G        D    G        D          G      D
Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
              A7    D
I think I'm a gonna cry
G        D    G        D            G      D
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
            A7       D               A7        D
I feel like I could die, bye bye my love, goodbye
 
 
[Outro]
 
     D      A7        D
Bye bye my love, goodbye
     D      A7        D
Bye bye my love, goodbye
     D      A7        D
Bye bye my love, goodbye...
