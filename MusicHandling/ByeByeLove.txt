
Capo:
no capo

[Chorus]
 
D       A     D       A          D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
              E     A
I think I'm a gonna cry
D       A     D       A             D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
            E       A               E         A  A  A
I feel like I could die, bye bye my love, goodbye

[Verse 1]
 
A             E                 A
There goes my baby with someone new
               E                A
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
           D                    E
She was my baby till he stepped in
           E                       A
Goodbye to romance that might have been
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D       A     D       A          D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
              E     A
I think I'm a gonna cry
D       A     D       A             D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
            E       A               E         A  A  A
I feel like I could die, bye bye my love, goodbye
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
                 E                         A
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
                 E                  A
I'm through with counting the stars above
               D                  E
And here's the reason that I'm so free
          E                    A
My lovin' baby is through with me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D       A     D       A          D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
              E     A
I think I'm a gonna cry
D       A     D       A             D     A
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
            E       A               E         A  A  A
I feel like I could die, bye bye my love, goodbye

    A      E        A
Bye bye my love, goodbye
    A      E        A
Bye bye my love, goodbye
    A      E        A
Bye bye my love, goodbye...
