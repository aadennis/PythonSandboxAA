misty



       Gm7           C7          Fmaj7
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
                    Fm9           Fm7
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
  Cmaj7         Am7
I can' t  under-stand
      Dm7    G7
I get misty,
                  Cmaj7  A7   Dm7   G7
Just holding your hand.
 
 
[Verse 2]
        Cmaj7
Walk my way,
      Gm7          C7            Fmaj7
And a thousand vio-lins begin to play,
                   Fm9               Fm7
Or it might be the sound of your hel-lo,
     Cmaj7    Am7
That music, I hear,
      Dm7    G7                   C      C7
I get misty,    the moment you're near.
 
 
[Bridge]
                    Gm7               C7
Can't you see that, leading me on?
                     Fmaj7            F6
And it's just what I want you to do,
                      Gbm7
Don't you notice how, hopelessly I'm lost
B7                            Em7
      That's why I'm following you.
A7   Dm7   G7
 
 
[Verse 3]
      Cmaj7          Gm7
On my own,    when I wander through
     C7           Fmaj7
this wonderland a-lone,
                 Fm9                Fm7
Never knowing my right foot from my left,
   Cmaj7          Am7
My hat,   from my glove,
        Dm7     G7                Cmaj7
I'm too misty,    and too much in love.
 C7          Dm7       G7
         Too misty,
                Cmaj7
And too much in love.....
