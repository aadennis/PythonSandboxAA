[Verse]
G                 C            G
It's a lesson too late for the learnin'
C       G      D       G
made of sand,  made of sand
G                 C              G
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
C        G       D       G
In your  hand ,  In your hand

[Chorus]
G       D                  C       G
Are you going away with no word of  farewell
           C        G                  D  D7
Will there be not a trace left behind?
        G                       C
Well, I 	could have 	loved 	you better,
       G
didn't mean to be unkind;
    D                 D7               G
You know that was the last thing on my mind.
[Verse]

G                    C          G
You've got reasons a-plenty for goin',
C      G     D      G
this I know  this I know.
G                       C        G
For the weeds have been steadily growin',
C            G    D            G
please don't go,  please don't go.

[Chorus]
G       D                  C            G
Are you going away with no word of  farewell

Will there be not a trace left behind?
        G                       C
Well, I 	could have 	loved 	you better,
       G
didn't mean to be unkind;
    D                 D7               G
You know that was the last thing on my mind.

[Verse]
G              C          G
As I lie in my bed in the mornin',
C       G    D       G
without you, without you.
G                C             G
Every song in my breast lies a bornin',
C       G     D       G
without you,  without you.

[Chorus]
G       D                  C       G
Are you going away with no word of  farewell
           C        G                  D  D7
Will there be not a trace left behind?

Well, I 	could have 	loved 	you better,
       G
didn't mean to be unkind;
    D                 D7               G
You know that was the last thing on my mind.
