[Verse]
 
    E                   B           B7  Bsus4    B       E
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
  A                           E                   B        B7      E
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better
 
    E               B               B7   Bsus4   B       E
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, you were made to   go out and get her 
    A                             E                B      B7      E
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better
 
[Chorus]
 
E7                         A         C#m      F#m           A         B7            
  And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon 
  E
your shoulders
E7                              A        C#m       F#m      A          B7           
  For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a 
  E
little colder

  So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone 
     E
to perform with
E7                                  A        C#m           F#m      A            B7 
  And don’t you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do, the movement you 
             E
need is on your shoulders
