Where it began  I can't begin to know when  But then I know it's growing  strong

A                   D                              A                                 E
Was in the spring, Â  and spring became the summer Who'd have believed you'd come a -long

A       A6              E             D                      E
Hands,  touching hands Reaching out, touching me, touching  you

A           D                                 E     A            D                             E
Sweet Caro -line, good times never seemed so  good I've been in-clined to believe they never  would

But  now  I

A                      D
Look at the night and  it don't seem so lonely
A                        E
We fill it up with only  two
A                 D                              A                            E
And when I hurt,  hurting runs off my shoulders How can I hurt when holdin'  you

A      A6             E             D                      E
Warm,  touching warm Reaching out, touching me, touching  you

A           D                                 E     A            D                             E      D
Sweet Caro -line, good times never seemed so  good I've been in-clined to believe they never  would

Oh  no  no

EEEE


A           D                                 E
Sweet Caro -line, good times never seemed so  good
A           D                           E
Sweet Caro  line, I believe they never  could
A           D                                 E
Sweet Caro -line, good times never seemed so  good
