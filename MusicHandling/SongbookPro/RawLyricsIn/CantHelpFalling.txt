[Verse 1]
 
C    Em  Am        F     C    G
Wise men say, only fools rush in
    F G     Am   F *        C    G    C
But I can't help falling in love with you
 
C     Em Am             F  C G
Shall I  stay, would it be a sin?
   F G     Am   F *        C    G    C
If I can't help falling in love with you
 
[Chorus]
 
Em           B7    Em            B7
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Em            B7
Darling so it goes
Em           A7            Dm  G
Some things  are  meant to be
 
[Verse 2]
 
C    Em Am            F     C    G
Take my hand, take my whole life too
    F G     Am   F          C    G    C
For I can't help falling in love with you
 
[Chorus]
 
Em           B7    Em            B7
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Em            B7
Darling so it goes
Em           A7            Dm  G
Some things  are  meant to be
 
[Verse 3]
 
C    Em Am            F     C    G
Take my hand, take my whole life too
    F G     Am   F          C    G    C   ( C )
For I can't help falling in love with you
    F G     Am   F          C    G    C
For I can't help falling in love with you
