[Verse]
G             C      G             D
Hey where did we go, days when the rains came
G           C       G         D
Down in the hollow, playin' a new game
G              C                 G              D
Laughin' and a-runnin' hey, hey, skippin’ and a-jumpin’
G            C                 G              D
In the misty mornin' fog with, ah, our hearts thumping

[Chorus]
    C   D              G    Em
And you  My brown-eyed girl,
C   D                 G    D
you’re my brown-eyed girl

[Verse]
G             C          G               D
And whatever  happened,  to Tuesday and  so slow
G               C                G           D
Goin’ down the  old mine with a  transistor  radio
G                C                   G                D
Standin’ in the  sunlight laughin’,  hidin’ behind a  rainbow's wall
G               C        G              D
Slippin’ and a- slidin’  all along the  waterfall

[Chorus]
     C   D              G    Em
With you  My brown-eyed girl,
C   D                 G    D
you’re my brown-eyed girl

[Bridge]

D7
Do you remember when we used to sing
G                      C            G      D
Sha la la la la la la  la la la la  te da  (just like that)
G                      C            G                D
Sha la la la la la la  la la la la  te da, la te da

[Verse]
G          C            G                      D
So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own
G                  C          G                D
I saw you just the other day, my, how you have grown
G       C                        G                      D
Cast my memory back there, Lord, sometimes I'm overcome thinkin’ about
G                  C            G          D
Makin’ love in the green grass, behind the stadium

[Chorus]
     C   D              G    Em
With you  My brown-eyed girl,
C   D                 G    D
you’re my brown-eyed girl
