It's been a hard day's night and I've been working like a dog
            G    C     G                  F               G
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
           C                           D                                G    C7  G   
But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do, will make me feel all right

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things and
     G                C        G                 F            G
it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything
          C                                 D                            G    C7 G
So why on earth should I moan, cause when I get you alone, you know I'll feel O. K.
