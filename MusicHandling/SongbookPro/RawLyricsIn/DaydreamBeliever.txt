Verse 1

           G               Am
Oh I could hide 'neath the wings
       Bm              C
Of the bluebird as she sings
    G          Em               A7   D7
The sixoclock alarm would never ring
       G           Am
But it rings and I rise
         Bm              C
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
   G       Em      Am   D7     G
My shaving razor's cold and it stings

Verse 2

G                   Am
You once thought of me
     Bm                  C
As a white knight on his steed
G                Em          A7 D7
Now you know how happy I can be
           G                    Am
Oh and our good times start and end
        Bm            C
Without dollar one to spend
    G        Em   Am    D7     G
But how much baby do we really need
