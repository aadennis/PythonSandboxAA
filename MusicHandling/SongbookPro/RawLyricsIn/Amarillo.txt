[Verse 1]
A               D       A          E
When the day is dawning on a Texas Sunday morning
A             D
How I long to be there
A                E
With Marie who's waiting for me there
F            C    F               C
Every lonely city where I hang my hat
F                C      Bm                 E
Ain't as half as pretty as where my baby's at
 
 
[Chorus]
A                    D
  Is this the way to Amarillo
A                       E
  Every night I've been hugging my pillow
A                    D        A          E          A
  Dreaming dreams of Amarillo  and sweet Marie who waits for me
A                    D
  Show me the way to Amarillo
A                   E
  I've been weeping like a willow
A             D        A          E          A
  Crying over Amarillo  and sweet Marie who waits for me
 
 
A            D         D
  Shalala lala lala la
A*           E         E
  Shalala lala lala la
D           A
  Shalala lala lala la
E                A
  and Marie who waits for me
 
 
[Verse 2]
A                     D
There's a church bell ringing
A                E
Hear the song of joy that it's singing
A             D     A                 E
For the sweet Maria and the guy who's coming to see her
F               C       F               C
Just beyond the highway there's an open plain
F               C     Bm                    E
and it keeps me going through the wind and rain
 
 
[Chorus]
A                    D
  Is this the way to Amarillo
A                       E
  Every night I've been hugging my pillow
A                    D        A          E          A
  Dreaming dreams of Amarillo  and sweet Marie who waits for me
A                    D
  Show me the way to Amarillo
A                   E
  I've been weeping like a willow
A             D        A          E          A
  Crying over Amarillo  and sweet Marie who waits for me
 
 
A            D         D
  Shalala lala lala la
A           E         E
  Shalala lala lala la
D*           A
  Shalala lala lala la
E                A
  and Marie who waits for me
