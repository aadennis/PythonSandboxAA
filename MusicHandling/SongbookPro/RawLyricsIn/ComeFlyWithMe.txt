Once I get you up there, where the air is rar - i - fied,
                  G#
We'll just glide, starry-eyed.
               G#                        G
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
G                    D7
You may hear all the an-gels cheer

Because we're to - geth - er,

weather-wise, it's such a lovely day!
(G7) CMaj7                   C7
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds

Down to Acapulco Bay;
      CMaj7                      Gm         A7
It's perfect for a flying hon-ey-moon, they say.

Come fly with me!  Let's fly, let's fly a - way.          (Oh, let’s fly!)
