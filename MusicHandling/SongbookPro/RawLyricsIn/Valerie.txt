C                                                       Dm
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
      C
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
                        Dm
and in my head I make a picture
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     F                                Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         F                               Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       C                         G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool out of me
                                C         Dm
Why won't you come on over Valer-ie? Valer-ie

        C
Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale 
                   Dm
Did you get a good lawyer?
           C
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you find the right man
              Dm
who'll fix it for you
        C                                                 
Are you shopping anywhere, changed the colour of your hair
        Dm
Are you busy?
            C
And did you have to pay the fine you were dodging all the time
              Dm
Are you still dizzy?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                     Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         F                               Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       Em                    G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool of me
                                C            Dm
Why won't you come on over Valerie?     Valerie
                                C            Dm
                           Valerie?     Valerie

And I think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I make a

And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       Em                    G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool of me
