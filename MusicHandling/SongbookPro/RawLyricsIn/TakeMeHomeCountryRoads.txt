[Verse]
G              Em
Almost heaven, West Virginia
D                     C          G
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah  River
G                  Em
Life is old there, older than the trees
D                           C              G
Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

[Chorus]
G                      D           Em        C
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
     G                  D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads

[Verse]
G               Em
All my memories gather 'round her
D             C                G
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
G               Em
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
D                         C              G
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

[Bridge]
Em         D            G
I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
    C     G                D
The radio reminds me of my home far away
    Em               F             C
And drivin' down the road, I get a feelin’
       G                    D
That I should’ve been home  yesterday, yesterday

[Chorus]
G                      D           Em        C
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
     G                  D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads
