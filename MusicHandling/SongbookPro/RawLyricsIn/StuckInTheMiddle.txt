Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
          D
I got the feeling that something ain't right
       G7
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
        D
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
 
A
Clowns to the left of me,
C             G             D
Jokers to the right, here I am,
 
Stuck in the middle with you.
 
 
        D
Yes I'm   stuck in the middle with you
        D
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
        G7
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
          D
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place

Well, you started out with nothing,
                                              D
And you're proud that you're a self made man
         G7
And your friends, they all come crawlin', slap you on the back and say,
D          Am7add11
Please.... Please.....
 
 
D
Trying to make some sense of it all
          D
But I can see that it makes no sense at all
      G7
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
               D
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
