# Python with AL’s API hooks

When we talk about “Python with AL’s API hooks,” we’re really talking about controlling Ableton Live from Python, either by sending MIDI or by directly manipulating clips, tracks, and devices via an API layer. Here's the landscape:

🧠 Two Main Paths to Python–Ableton Integration
1. MIDI via Python (simpler, indirect)
- Uses libraries like rtmidi to send MIDI messages to AL.
- You set up a virtual MIDI bus (e.g., loopMIDI on Windows).
- Python sends notes, CCs, etc., and AL receives them like any external controller.
- Great for triggering clips, notes, or automation—but no direct access to clip properties.
2. AbletonOSC + PyLive (direct control)
- This is the real “API hook” route.
- Uses AbletonOSC as a bridge between Python and AL.
- You can:
- Query and modify clip length, loop points, tempo, track names, etc.
- Trigger clips, scenes, and even tweak device parameters.
- Extend clips programmatically—exactly what you were exploring manually.


## 🔧 Example: Extend a Clip via PyLive

```
import live

# Connect to the current Live set
set = live.Set(scan=True)

# Access a specific track and clip
track = set.tracks[0]
clip = track.clips[0]

# Extend the clip length to 8 bars
clip.length = 8.0
```

That’s the kind of atomic control you’d want for scripting your “blank space” logic directly—no UI gymnastics needed.


## 🛠️ Setup Notes
- Requires Ableton Live 11+ and Python 3.7+
- You’ll need to install pylive via pip:

```
pip install pylive
```

'https://pypi.org/project/pylive/'


```

```
To check that pylive is communicating successfully with Ableton Live, try running one of the examples, or run the test suite with:

python3 setup.py test
```

```
You're hitting a common snag that stems from a shift in how pylive communicates with Ableton Live. Here's the key detail: LiveOSC is no longer supported in the latest versions of pylive (from v0.3.0 onward). Instead, it now interfaces exclusively with AbletonOSC for Live 11+.

```
```
✅ 1. Ableton Live 11+
✅ 2. Install and Run AbletonOSC
- Clone and install AbletonOSC in your Ableton Live setup.
- Follow the setup instructions to enable the Python server that bridges OSC messages to Live.
