# Lesson learned: do not use mido for creating MIDI files.
# A simple example of creating a one-bar MIDI file using music21
# pip install music21
# After hours of struggling with mido, I decided to try music21,
# and based on this simple example, it seems to be a much better choice.
# I was able to drag this into Ableton Live and it worked perfectly.
# This is the start of a simple drum track (Channel 10) 
# with a kick and snare (respectively MIDI note 36 (C1) and 38 (D1)).
