[Verse 1]

G                  D            G
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
G                 D                G
Meant for someone else but not for me.
C               G
Love was out to get me
C                 G
That's the way it seemed.
C              G              D      N.C.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
 
 
[Chorus]

               G   C  G
Then I saw her face,
    C       G     C  G
now I'm a believer
C     G     C   G
Not a trace
   C           G    C  G
of doubt in my mind.
C      G    N.C.     C
I'm in love, (ooooh, ah yeah)
        G                  F              D
I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried.
 
 
[Verse 2]

G                  D              G
I thought love was more or less a given thing,
G                D               G
Seems the more I gave the less I got.
C                 G
What's the use in tryin'?
C              G
All you get is pain.
C             G              D     N.C.
When I needed sunshine I got rain.
 
 
[Chorus]

               G   C  G
Then I saw her face,
    C       G     C  G
now I'm a believer.
C     G     C   G
Not a trace
   C           G    C  G
of doubt in my mind.
C      G    N.C.     C
I'm in love, (ooooh, ah yeah)
        G                  F              D
I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried.

[Verse 3]

C               G
Love was out to get me.
C                 G
That's the way it seemed.
C              G              D      N.C.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
 
 
[Chorus]

               G   C  G
Then I saw her face,
    C       G     C  G
now I'm a believer.

I'm a believer! I couldn't leave her if I tried.
 
 
[Outro]

               G   C  G
Yes, I saw her face,
    C       G     C  G
now I'm a believer
C     G     C   G
Not a trace
   C           G    C  G
of doubt in my mind.
     C       G     C  G
Said I'm a believer
C        G    C  G
I'm a believer
     C       G       C       G
Said I'm a believer (I'm a believer)
     C       G       C       G
Said I'm a believer (I'm a believer)
