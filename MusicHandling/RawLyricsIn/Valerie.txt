[Verse 1]
 
     C                                                  Dm
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water
      C
And I think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I make a
Dm
picture
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                     Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         F                               Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       Em                    G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool of me
                                C            Dm
Why won't you come on over Valerie?     Valerie
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        C
Did you have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a
     Dm
good lawyer?
           C
I hope you didn't catch a tan, I hope you find the right man who'll fix it
Dm
for you
        C                                                           Dm
Are you shopping anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, are you busy?
            C
And did you have to pay the fine you were dodging all the time are you
      Dm
still dizzy?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                     Em
'Cos since I've come on home, well my body's been a mess
         F                               Em
And I've missed your ginger hair and the way you like to dress
F                       Em                    G
Won't you come on over, stop making a fool of me
                                C            Dm
Why won't you come on over Valerie?     Valerie
                                C            Dm
                           Valerie?     Valerie

Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water

And I think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I make a
