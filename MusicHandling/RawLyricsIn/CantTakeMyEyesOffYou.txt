 
[Verse 1]

                E
You're just too good to be true
              Emaj7
Can't take my eyes off you
         E7
You feel like Heaven to touch
        A
I wanna hold you so much
             Am
At long last love has arrived
            E
And I thank God I'm alive
                F#m7       F#m7b5
You're just too good to be true
              E
Can't take my eyes off you
 
[Verse 2]

           E
Pardon the way that I stare
                Emaj7
There's nothing else to compare
                 E7
The sight of you makes me weak
             A
There are no words left to speak
           Am
But if you feel like I feel
              E
Please let me know that it's real
                F#m7       F#m7b5
You're just too good to be true
              E
Can't take my eyes off you
