Setup
1. When running the test to generate the csv file, you must open the PythonSandboxAA folder in  VSCode, and then run the test
2. The code will detect if you have mis-formatting (eg 2040 112 when should be 2040112), but probably not a clear indication.
3. There must be only one trailing space at the end of the input/dictation file, else that will be read as a "not enough items"
